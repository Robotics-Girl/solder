# Simple PCB Heart 
My project is a simple pcb board that is in the shape of a heart that has a multi-heart drawn into it. I find it aesthetic and pleasing. It has two leds, two resistors, and one battery. <img width="209" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-11 at 9 01 28â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92a010c2-0943-4737-827c-193becdb113b" />
